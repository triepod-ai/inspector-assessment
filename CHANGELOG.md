## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added

- **Calculator Injection Detection**: New security pattern to detect eval() execution in calculator/math tools
  - 7 test payloads: Simple arithmetic (2+2, 5*5), natural language (what is 10*10), code injection (**import**)
  - Evidence patterns match specific response format ("The answer is X")
  - Low false positive risk (doesn't match generic numeric responses)
  - Integrates with existing pattern system (13 patterns total, up from 12)
  - Added to Basic mode as 4th critical injection pattern

### Changed

- Security pattern count increased from 12 to 13
- Basic mode: 3 → 4 critical injection patterns (~13 → ~20 checks)
- Advanced mode: 8 → 13 patterns (~24 → ~37 checks per tool)
- UI badge updated: "8 Patterns" → "13 Patterns"
- Test descriptions updated to include Calculator Injection and Tool-Specific Vulnerabilities

### Fixed

- **API Wrapper False Negative**: Parameter-aware payload injection now correctly detects vulnerabilities in API wrapper tools

### Technical Details

- Pattern location: `client/src/lib/securityPatterns.ts`
- Category: Critical Injection Tests (alongside Command, SQL, Path Traversal)
- Evidence format: `/The answer is \d+/i` (specific to vulnerable calculator tools)
- No changes to SecurityAssessor.ts needed (uses existing assessment flow)

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-13

### Added

- **UI Enhancement**: Filter Errors button in Security and Error Handling sections for improved debugging workflow

### Fixed

- **Assessment Accuracy**: Count only scored tests in passed and total counts
- **Security Detection**: Detect 'Unknown tool' as tool list sync error, not SECURE status
- **Security Assessment**: Eliminate false positive on safe_info_tool_mcp reflection detection
- **Security Status**: Overall Security status now FAIL when connection errors occur
- **Test Scoring**: Mark connection errors as failed tests, not passed

### Changed

- **Branding**: Renamed application from "MCP Inspector" to "MCP Assessor" to better reflect comprehensive assessment capabilities

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-12

### Fixed

- **Validation False Positives in Security Testing**: Tools properly validating input are no longer incorrectly flagged as vulnerable
  - Added MCP error code detection (JSON-RPC -32602 Invalid params)
  - Added execution evidence requirement for ambiguous patterns (distinguishes "type error in validation" from "type error during execution")
  - Fixed 18 validation patterns including boundary validation ("cannot be empty", "required field")
  - Implemented 3-layer validation approach: MCP codes → patterns → execution evidence
  - Universal fix applies to ALL MCP servers, not just specific tools

- **API Operational Error Detection**: Functionality assessment now correctly recognizes operational errors as working behavior
  - Added 11 API operational error patterns (credits, billing, quotas, rate limits)
  - Added 5 generic validation patterns (invalid input, invalid parameter)
  - Expanded validation-expected tool types (scrape, crawl, map, extract, parse, analyze, process)
  - Adjusted confidence weighting for better accuracy (20% threshold for operational errors, 30% for validation tools)

### Changed

- **UI Text Updates**: Updated security testing descriptions to reflect current 8-pattern architecture
  - Changed badge from "18 Patterns" to "8 Patterns"
  - Updated test descriptions to reflect 3 critical injection patterns (basic) and 8 total patterns (advanced)
  - Updated security guidance mapping for all 8 current patterns (Command, SQL, Path Traversal, Type Safety, Boundary, Required Fields, MCP Error Format, Timeout)

### Added

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 29 new tests validating false positive fixes (all passing)
  - 12 SecurityAssessor validation tests (MCP error codes, execution evidence, boundary validation)
  - 5 Firecrawl integration tests (real-world operational error scenarios)
  - 12 ResponseValidator tests (API operational errors, rate limiting, input validation)

### Technical Details

- **Files Changed**: 6 files (1,878 insertions, 782 deletions)
- **Universal Application**: Changes in `analyzeResponse()` method apply to all tools and all security patterns
- **Detection Flow**: All tools → all patterns → `testPayload()` → `analyzeResponse()` (contains fixes)
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to API or assessment interfaces

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added

- **Confidence Scoring for Security Assessments**: Intelligent confidence levels reduce false positives from ambiguous pattern matches

### Improved
