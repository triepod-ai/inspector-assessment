# Project Status: MCP Inspector

## Current Version

- **Version**: 1.19.1 (published to npm as "@bryan-thompson/inspector-assessment")

**Summary:** Fixed three inspector assessment bugs affecting destructiveHint detection and business error recognition, published v1.19.4 to npm.

**Session Focus:** Bug fixes for inspector-assessment based on comprehensive bug report from memory-mcp testing.

**Changes Made:**
- `client/src/services/assessment/modules/ToolAnnotationAssessor.ts` - Added early return for CREATE operations before persistence detection (lines 1244-1257)
- `client/src/services/assessment/ResponseValidator.ts` - Added missing operation patterns (add, insert, modify, set, remove, entity, entities, relation, observation, node, edge, record) to isValidationExpected
- `client/src/services/assessment/modules/ToolAnnotationAssessor.test.ts` - Split test for CREATE vs UPDATE/MODIFY semantic distinction
- `/home/bryan/mcp-logs/memory-mcp/inspector-assessment/bug-report-2025-12-30-142109.md` - Updated status to ALL BUGS FIXED & VERIFIED

**Key Decisions:**
- CREATE operations are NEVER destructive regardless of persistence model (only add new data)
- Business error detection must recognize entity/relation/observation operations as validation-expected
- Separated test cases for CREATE vs UPDATE semantics to properly validate behavior

**Key Results:**
- All 1119 tests pass
- v1.19.4 published to npm (4 packages)
- memory-mcp now shows 12/12 tools working after server-side fix verification
- Bug report fully updated with fix details and verification results

**Commits:**
- `0466cdb` chore: bump version to 1.19.3
- `e263825` feat(annotations): Add three-tier persistence detection for write operations

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor for any additional false positives in production assessments
- Consider adding more comprehensive semantic operation detection

**Notes:**
- Bug 1 was server-side (memory-mcp missing structuredContent) - verified fixed after Docker rebuild
- Bugs 2-4 were inspector bugs - all fixed in this session
- Version bump included package-lock.json sync fix

## 2025-12-31: v1.19.5 Release - Unicode Bypass Security Tests Now Executing in Basic Mode

**Summary:** Fixed Unicode Bypass security tests not being executed in basic mode by adding the pattern to criticalPatterns array, validated with A/B testbed comparison, and published v1.19.5 to npm.

**Session Focus:** Bug investigation using code-reviewer-pro agent, root cause analysis of Unicode Bypass test gap, security assessment validation, and npm package release.

**Changes Made:**
- `client/src/services/assessment/modules/SecurityAssessor.ts` - Added "Unicode Bypass" to criticalPatterns array (lines 342-349)
- Version bump to 1.19.5
- Published @bryan-thompson/inspector-assessment@1.19.5 to npm

**Key Decisions:**
- **Root cause was NOT createTestParameters()**: Code review proved the parameter matching logic works correctly. The actual issue was Unicode Bypass being excluded from basic mode's criticalPatterns array.
- **Added to basic mode**: Unicode Bypass is now the 5th critical pattern tested in basic mode (was 4)
- **A/B validation approach**: Tested against both vulnerable-mcp (167 vulns) and hardened-mcp (0 vulns) to confirm no false positives

**Key Results:**
- Unicode Bypass tests: 0 -> 58
- Vulnerabilities detected: 6 on unicode_processor_tool
- False positives: 0 (A/B validated)
- Total tests: 3422

**Commits:**
- `704ef33` fix(security): add Unicode Bypass to basic mode critical patterns
- `4defa99` chore: bump version to 1.19.5

**Next Steps:**
- Consider adding Nested Injection to criticalPatterns (same exclusion issue)
- Add unit tests for createTestParameters() to prevent future regressions
- Document which patterns are tested in Basic vs Advanced mode

**Notes:**
- Bug report suspected wrong location - code review was essential to find actual root cause
- Docker logs proved payloads were never being sent (not a detection issue)
- Single-line fix with major security coverage impact

## 2025-12-31: v1.19.6 Release - AUP Module JSONL Enrichment for Downstream Claude Analysis

**Summary:** Added AUP enrichment to JSONL module_complete events enabling downstream Claude analysis of policy violations

**Session Focus:** Enhancing the AUP (Acceptable Use Policy) module's JSONL output with structured violation data for downstream analysis tools.

**Changes Made:**
- `scripts/lib/jsonl-events.ts` - Added AUP types (AUPViolationSample, AUPViolationMetrics, AUPEnrichment) and buildAUPEnrichment helper function
- `client/src/services/assessment/AssessmentOrchestrator.ts` - Emit AUP enrichment data when module=aup in module_complete events
- `docs/REAL_TIME_PROGRESS_OUTPUT.md` - Documented new AUP event format with field descriptions
- Version bump to 1.19.6
- Updated CLAUDE.md version reference to 1.19.6
- Published @bryan-thompson/inspector-assessment@1.19.6 to npm

**Key Decisions:**
- **Enriched existing event**: Extended module_complete event rather than creating a separate aup_findings event, maintaining consistency with existing JSONL event patterns
- **Severity-prioritized sampling**: Violations sampled CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM, capped at 10 samples to balance detail with payload size
- **Comprehensive metrics**: Added violationMetrics with total/critical/high/medium counts plus byCategory breakdown

**New AUP Enrichment Fields:**
- `violationsSample` - Up to 10 sampled violations, prioritized by severity
- `samplingNote` - Human-readable note about sampling (e.g., "10 of 17 violations shown")
- `violationMetrics` - Aggregated counts: total, critical, high, medium, byCategory
- `scannedLocations` - Array of locations that were scanned
- `highRiskDomains` - Array of detected high-risk domains

**Validation Results:**
- Tested against vulnerable-mcp server
- 17 total violations detected
- 10 violations sampled with correct severity prioritization
- All fields populated correctly in JSONL output

**Commits:**
- `[version bump]` chore: bump version to 1.19.6

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor downstream tool consumption of new AUP enrichment fields
- Consider similar enrichment patterns for other assessment modules
- Add unit tests for buildAUPEnrichment helper

**Notes:**
- This enhancement enables AI-powered analysis pipelines to process AUP findings without parsing full assessment results
- Sampling approach prevents payload bloat while preserving high-severity findings
- JSONL format maintains real-time streaming capability for large assessments

## 2025-12-31: v1.19.7 Release - TemporalAssessor False Positive Fix for Accumulation Operations

**Summary:** Fixed TemporalAssessor false positive that flagged accumulation operations like add_observations as rug pull vulnerabilities

**Session Focus:** Bug fix for TemporalAssessor - preventing false positives on stateful accumulation operations

**Changes Made:**
- `client/src/services/assessment/modules/TemporalAssessor.ts` - Added accumulation patterns to STATEFUL_TOOL_PATTERNS, implemented word-boundary regex matching, expanded normalizeResponse counter patterns
- `client/src/services/assessment/__tests__/TemporalAssessor.test.ts` - Added tests for accumulation operations, word-boundary matching, and integration test for add_observations scenario

**Key Decisions:**
- **Word-boundary regex matching**: Used pattern `(^|_|-)pattern($|_|-)` instead of substring matching to prevent false matches (e.g., "address_validator" won't match "add")
- **Accumulation patterns added**: 8 new patterns - add, append, store, save, log, record, push, enqueue
- **Destructive tool priority**: Kept destructive tool check first to ensure tools like "add_and_delete" still get strict comparison

**Technical Details:**
- Root cause: Substring matching caused "add" to match any tool containing those letters
- Fix: Word-boundary regex ensures only exact pattern matches at word boundaries
- Counter field expansion: Added totalRecords, pendingCount, queueLength to normalizeResponse

**Validation Results:**
- All 1148 tests passing
- Verified fix against memory-mcp server (temporal module passes)
- Published as v1.19.7 to npm

**Commits:**
- `fix(temporal)` - Prevent false positives on accumulation operations

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor for any edge cases with new stateful patterns
- Consider adding more counter field patterns as discovered

**Notes:**
- This fix improves precision of rug pull detection while maintaining sensitivity to actual temporal manipulation attacks
- The word-boundary approach is more robust than maintaining an exclusion list
- Pattern applies to tool names like add_observations, append_data, store_result, etc.

## 2025-12-31: CLI Module Flag & JSONL Events API Documentation

**Summary:** Added --module flag for individual assessment module execution and created comprehensive JSONL Events API documentation

**Session Focus:** CLI enhancement for module-specific testing and documentation of JSONL event streaming interface

**Changes Made:**
- `scripts/run-security-assessment.ts` - Major refactor: added MODULE_REGISTRY with 13 assessors, --module CLI flag, generic runModule() function, combined results structure
- `docs/JSONL_EVENTS_API.md` - NEW: 1,693-line comprehensive event reference for CLI/auditor integration (11 event types, TypeScript interfaces, integration examples)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added JSONL API reference in Feature Documentation section
- `/home/bryan/mcp-auditor/CLAUDE.md` - Added Inspector JSONL Output Mapping section with event-to-usage table

**Key Decisions:**
- **Default modules changed**: Now includes both security and aupCompliance (was security only)
- **Full module names only**: No shortcuts like "sec" -> "security" for clarity
- **Comprehensive approach**: ~3-4 hour effort chosen over minimal enhancement to provide complete module access

**Technical Details:**
- All 13 modules now individually testable via CLI:
  - security, aupCompliance, functionality, documentation, errorHandling
  - usability, mcpSpec, toolAnnotations, prohibitedLibraries, manifestValidation
  - portability, externalAPIScanner, temporal
- Backward compatibility: deprecated --aup flag still works
- Combined results structure when running multiple modules

**Commits:**
- `8bf6813` feat(cli): add --module flag for individual assessment module execution

**Next Steps:**
- Test module combinations in CI/CD pipeline
- Update mcp-auditor to consume new JSONL events
- Consider adding module-specific CLI flags for common patterns

**Notes:**
- JSONL Events API doc covers all 11 event types with TypeScript interfaces
- Module registry pattern enables easy addition of future assessment modules
- Documentation enables third-party tool integration with inspector output stream
