# Enhanced Tool Details Modal Test

## What Was Enhanced

The tool details modal now shows comprehensive test data with proper formatting including:

### 1. **Test Scenario Details**

- Scenario name, description, category (happy_path, edge_case, boundary, error_case)
- Pass/fail status with confidence percentage

### 2. **Test Input Parameters**

- Full JSON display of the actual parameters sent to the tool
- Blue-bordered box for easy identification

### 3. **Tool Response**

- The actual response or error returned by the tool
- Execution time in milliseconds
- Different colored backgrounds (red for errors, gray for responses)

### 4. **Expected Behavior**

- What the test scenario expected the tool to do
- Yellow background for easy distinction

### 5. **Assessment Results**

- Classification (fully_working, partially_working, broken)
- Whether it was an execution error or proper response
- Issues found (in red)
- Evidence of correct behavior (in green)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Run an Assessment**:
   - Go to the Assessment tab
   - Enable "Enhanced Testing (Multi-scenario validation)"
   - Run assessment on any MCP server

2. **View Tool Details**:
   - In the Functionality section, click on any tool name link
   - This opens the enhanced modal

3. **Examine Test Data**:
   - Each scenario now shows:
     - **Input**: What parameters were sent
     - **Response**: What the tool actually returned
     - **Assessment**: Why it was classified as working/broken
   - This gives complete insight into what the tool is doing

## Formatting Improvements

- **Proper JSON Formatting**: JSON data maintains proper indentation and structure
- **Controlled Scrolling**: JSON sections have contained horizontal/vertical scrolling with max height
- **Monospace Font**: Uses `font-mono` for consistent character spacing in code blocks
- **Readable Layout**: Larger modal (max-w-4xl) with proper overflow handling
- **Proper Spacing**: Clear visual separation between sections
- **Preserved Structure**: JSON formatting preserved with `whitespace-pre` for readability

## Benefits

- **Debugging**: See exactly what inputs caused failures
- **Validation**: Understand why tools are classified as working/broken
- **Insight**: Full visibility into tool behavior and responses
- **Business Logic**: Distinguish between tool failures and proper resource validation
- **Easy Reading**: No more horizontal scrolling or cramped text

This enhancement transforms the assessment from a simple pass/fail into a comprehensive debugging and analysis tool with professional formatting.
